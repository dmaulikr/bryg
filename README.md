BRYG (from Blue, Red, Yellow and Green) introduces a game of 255 colored blocks placed randomly on a 16x16 board, leaving exactly one slot unoccupied.

The gameplay is very simple: Swipe your finger on the screen in a horizontal or vertical direction to move a block onto the unoccupied slot. This counts as a single move. 

Your goal is to move the blocks around the board so that blocks of same color are placed together into their respective corners as labeled on the board.

Easy! Right? But thereâ€™s a catch. You have to solve the puzzle in the least number of moves. There is no time limit, so plan your moves. Challenge your friends to play BRYG and keep your moves to a minimum to make your way up the leaderboard.

If you enjoy playing BRYG, please consider leaving a review.

Good luck!
